# 📡 Overby Telemetry Format v1 (OTF‑1)

**Overby Industries – Telemetry Protocol Specification**

---

## 🌌 Overview
OTF‑1 (Overby Telemetry Format v1) the canonical open protocol, but also ties together with the Overby certification frameworks:

- SMESSC → Space Mining Environmental, Safety, & Sustainability Certification
- ODCI → Orbital Debris Cleanup Index (live metric)
- Proof of Cleanup (PoC) credits → blockchain‑verifiable KPI
- Overby Transparency Dashboard → the place where OTF‑1 feeds + certifications display

This becomes our authority layer → regulators, insurers, investors, operators see Overby as both operator AND standards body, much like ISO for space.

OTF‑1 defines the **Overby Telemetry Format** for real‑time reporting of:
- Autonomous space mining operations
- Orbital debris reclamation
- Environmental impact metrics
- Certification compliance (SMESSC, ODCI)

This open standard ensures Overby’s transparency while enabling:
- 📡 Public trust via live data feeds
- 🔍 Auditable logs for regulators/insurers
- 🤝 Interoperability across fleets and partners

---

## 🚀 Why OTF‑1?
- **Trust** → Transparency is verifiable via blockchain Proof of Cleanup credit logging.  
- **Authority** → OTF‑1 standardizes reporting across all Overby missions.  
- **Interoperability** → Designed for spacecraft PLC runtimes + ground ops dashboards.  
- **Legitimacy** → Enables international recognition and compliance.

## 🪐 Certification Frameworks
- SMESSC (Space Mining Environmental, Safety & Sustainability Certification)
  - ✅ Ensures operations follow Overby’s zero-waste, risk‑mitigated, and ethical mining/reclamation standards.
  - ✅ Incorporated into every OTF packet under certifications.SMESSC.

- ODCI (Orbital Debris Cleanup Index)
  - ✅ Aggregated global metric (percentage of orbit cleaned, debris mass removed).
  - ✅ Incremental contributions (ODCI_contribution) are logged per event.
  - ✅ Investors/regulators can watch “orbital health” in a live metric.

- Proof of Cleanup Credits (PoC)
  -  ✅ Every debris capture/removal event issues a blockchain token.
  - ✅ Immutable record that “X object was reclaimed, Y kg removed”.
  - ✅ Tradable or certifiable with insurers/operators as compliance evidence.
