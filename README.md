# 📡 Overby Telemetry Format v1 (OTF‑1)

**Overby Industries – Telemetry Protocol Specification**

---

## 🌌 Overview
OTF‑1 (Overby Telemetry Format v1) the canonical open protocol, but also ties together with the Overby certification frameworks:

- SMESSC → Space Mining Environmental, Safety, & Sustainability Certification
- ODCI → Orbital Debris Cleanup Index (live metric)
- Proof of Cleanup (PoC) credits → blockchain‑verifiable KPI
- Overby Transparency Dashboard → the place where OTF‑1 feeds + certifications display

This becomes our authority layer → regulators, insurers, investors, operators see Overby as both operator AND standards body, much like ISO for space.

OTF‑1 defines the **Overby Telemetry Format** for real‑time reporting of:
- Autonomous space mining operations
- Orbital debris reclamation
- Environmental impact metrics
- Certification compliance (SMESSC, ODCI)

This open standard ensures Overby’s transparency while enabling:
- 📡 Public trust via live data feeds
- 🔍 Auditable logs for regulators/insurers
- 🤝 Interoperability across fleets and partners

---

## 🚀 Why OTF‑1?
- **Trust** → Transparency is verifiable via blockchain Proof of Cleanup credit logging.  
- **Authority** → OTF‑1 standardizes reporting across all Overby missions.  
- **Interoperability** → Designed for spacecraft PLC runtimes + ground ops dashboards.  
- **Legitimacy** → Enables international recognition and compliance.

## 🪐 Certification Frameworks
- SMESSC (Space Mining Environmental, Safety & Sustainability Certification)
  - ✅ Ensures operations follow Overby’s zero-waste, risk‑mitigated, and ethical mining/reclamation standards.
  - ✅ Incorporated into every OTF packet under certifications.SMESSC.

- ODCI (Orbital Debris Cleanup Index)
  - ✅ Aggregated global metric (percentage of orbit cleaned, debris mass removed).
  - ✅ Incremental contributions (ODCI_contribution) are logged per event.
  - ✅ Investors/regulators can watch “orbital health” in a live metric.

- Proof of Cleanup Credits (PoC)
  -  ✅ Every debris capture/removal event issues a blockchain token.
  - ✅ Immutable record that “X object was reclaimed, Y kg removed”.
  - ✅ Tradable or certifiable with insurers/operators as compliance evidence.

# ✅ Benefits

- OTF‑1 schema JSON = **machine & human readable** telemetry → simple, global adoption.  
- Certification integration: SMESSC ✅ | ODCI ✅ | PoC Credit ✅.  
- Creates Overby’s **authority layer** → you’re not just *cleaning space*, you’re **defining the rules of the game**.  
- This signals to **UN, ESA, NASA, insurers**: *“Overby sets the standard globally.”*  
- Public sees transparent metrics → “leaps and bounds” feel LITERAL on your dashboard.

## 📡 Example Usage
`✔ Reclaimer Pod Capture Event`
The pod captures a 5.2kg fragment →

- OTF‑1 packet is emitted
- Blockchain PoC credit registered
- Dashboard updated live
- ODCI increment updated by +5kg
- SMESSC flag confirms safe, certified process

`✔ Mining Pod Refinery Report`
Pod converts asteroid regolith into UHPC aggregate →

- OTF‑1 packet logs processing
- SMESSC compliance verified (dust contained, zero orbital debris)
- Environmental/safety scores updated

## 🔮 Roadmap for OTF‑1
Phase 1 (Q4 2025):

- Schema finalized in open consultation (Overby GitHub Issues)
- Simulation feeds (mock JSON events) published

Phase 2 (Q2 2026):

- Ground demo rigs output real telemetry
- Dashboard uses live‑updating WebSocket API

Phase 3 (2030‑2035):

- First Orbital Demonstrators push OTF‑1 packets from CubeSats
- Proof of Cleanup credits issued publicly

Phase 4 (2035+):

- All Overby fleets exclusively speak OTF‑1
- Certification & ODCI adoption by regulators/insurers

## 🧑‍🚀 How to Contribute
- Open Issues to propose schema updates
- Submit PRs for JSON schema docs, validation tools, or API middleware
- Share expertise in telemetry, PLC comms, or blockchain audit

## 📜 License
OTF‑1 is released under Apache 2.0 for full open-source adoption.
